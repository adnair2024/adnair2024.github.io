I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to make a public blog on GH pages for
such a long time, and I never got around to doing it. Now, I can finally say
&amp;ldquo;ha check my blog&amp;rdquo;, and mean it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m currently using Hugo as the brain for my blog, and a theme called
&lt;code&gt;hugo-brewm&lt;/code&gt;. It looks really nice, and I had Gemini replicate the demo layout
because I found it really pretty. Took a couple hours of work, and I spent that
time drinking coffee and coding in a small coffee shop downstairs from the
apartment.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This is my first post. I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to make a public blog on GH pages for

&lt;p&gt;This blog is meant to be a beautiful and brutalist peak into my brain, inspired
by the design (and home decor) philosophy of Rick Owens. I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading a lot
about how Owens thinks and performs daily activities, and I think its a nice
and clean way to go about life. I&amp;rsquo;m going to have to wait to make setup content
until I&amp;rsquo;m back home, but for now, I&amp;rsquo;ll go ahead and brainstorm some other ideas
for blog posts. Maybe about Zelda: Tears of The Kingdom?&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><category>General</category></item></channel></rss>
