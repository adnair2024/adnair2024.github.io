&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.imgur.com/q73QIOV.jpeg" alt="header"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a world where we use technology all day, I think using physical writing tools
is really beneficial. I wake up every morning and write in my journal, about the
day before. This helps me filter the important parts of the previous day in
my mind, and also is a nice part of my daily routine that helps me stay active.
In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll show the physical tools I use in my day to day life.
Below, I&amp;rsquo;ll provide Amazon links to the products I&amp;rsquo;ve purchased.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;h1 id="physical-stationary-that-brings-me-daily-enjoyment"&gt;Physical Stationary That Brings Me Daily Enjoyment&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h3 id="main-journaling-pen---aihao-x97-05mm"&gt;Main Journaling Pen - Aihao X97 0.5mm&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.imgur.com/DqTw0Yt.jpeg" alt="aihao-pen"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love this pen. I purchased a 10 pack of these pens around a month ago for
journaling and multipurpose note-taking, and I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed them ever since. For
someone who journals every day, and plans projects on physical paper, it&amp;rsquo;s a
real pleasure to write on. I chose to get black ink, even though you can get a
mixed pack or red only or blue only. The transparent color of the pen makes it
look nice when resting on your notebook. The 0.5mm nib makes it easy to write
small, which is important for me when I am scribbling notes every day. It&amp;rsquo;s a
great and affordable daily driver. Ink doesn&amp;rsquo;t skip at all, and if it does this
is a refillable pen so you can just swap the refill. The ink unfortunately does
take a minute or so to dry, which can create some smudging but nothing major. The
ink doesn&amp;rsquo;t bleed at all onto the back of the page, making it great for using both
sides of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="annotation-pen---generic-roller-ball-pen-07mm-blue"&gt;Annotation Pen - Generic Roller Ball Pen 0.7mm (Blue)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.imgur.com/bUN3qBR.jpeg" alt="roller-ball"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I can&amp;rsquo;t find the actual name of this pen. It&amp;rsquo;s an amazing pen, and
if I liked using blue ink for my notes I would probably use it. It&amp;rsquo;s a 0.7 mm
nib size, so it&amp;rsquo;s a little thicker than the Aihao pen I use for planning and
journaling. This makes it great for editing notes that I wrote previously. The
ink dries faster than the Aihao. The only drawback of this pen is really that it
feels cheap in your hand; chunky but light. Well, that and the slight
bleeding onto the other side of the page. This pen feels like if it drops,
it would shatter into pieces. The amazing writing quality makes up for the cheap
build quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="journal---mnemosyne-a5-notebook"&gt;Journal - Mnemosyne A5 Notebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.imgur.com/X5qJ25t.jpeg" alt="mnemosyne"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my stationary pride and joy. This is the best notebook I&amp;rsquo;ve ever used.
Mnemosyne is a company I&amp;rsquo;ve been using on and off since 2020, and they have never
let me down. The notebook is built extremely well, with double spiral binding and
possibly some of the best quality paper I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen. The paper is glossy, but
not cheap or too slick. It retains ink really well and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t suggest a better
notebook. In addition to the quality of this product, the size makes it perfect.
This is an A5 notebook, and is perfect for a smaller notebook or bag, and can
accompany you everywhere. The pages are perforated, so you can tear out pages with
ease. This makes it significantly better for notes or todo lists that you can
quickly get ripped off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="miscellaneous-notebook---pengear-simulated-leather-notebook"&gt;Miscellaneous Notebook - Pen+Gear Simulated Leather Notebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.imgur.com/9hGpgId.jpeg" alt="pen+gear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a cheap simulated leather notebook that I purchased at Walmart, and
I&amp;rsquo;m pretty surprised about how much use I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten out of it. I used the
brown variant that came in the two pack and basically finished it, and now
I&amp;rsquo;ve moved on to the yellow (or &amp;ldquo;golden pond&amp;rdquo;) color and it has not disappointed
yet. The simulated leather allows for the notebook to be really slim and cheap.
Good crisp paper is nice, an opposite of the glossy and sleek paper to the paper
in the Mnemosyne notebook&amp;rsquo;s paper. A notebook you&amp;rsquo;ll enjoy using and won&amp;rsquo;t lose
sleep over losing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="pencil-case"&gt;Pencil Case&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.imgur.com/AIEQTm0.jpeg" alt="pencil-case"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought this pencil case on a whim, and it&amp;rsquo;s paid off. I&amp;rsquo;m very happy with it since
the quality is really amazing for $20, and it holds pens, pencils, pencil lead,
and lip balm. To easily access this, you can pull out the drawer style pen
holder. What stands out is the build quality; not sure if this is real leather
or faux, but it and the inner suede is stunning. A pleasure to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While my digital tools definitely do the most in my workflow, these physical
items are what makes my personal routine feel intentional. I like the mental clarity
that comes from the friction of pen on paper, that digital writing cannot
give us. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s the Aihao X97 0.5mm pen, or the Mnemosyne notebook, having
these makes me want to write and stick to my routine. I think these are a great
way to combat screen fatigue and keep productive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog is meant to be a beautiful and brutalist peak into my brain, inspired
by the design (and home decor) philosophy of Rick Owens. I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading a lot
about how Owens thinks and performs daily activities, and I think its a nice
and clean way to go about life. I&amp;rsquo;m going to have to wait to make setup content
until I&amp;rsquo;m back home, but for now, I&amp;rsquo;ll go ahead and brainstorm some other ideas
for blog posts. Maybe about Zelda: Tears of The Kingdom?&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><category>General</category></item></channel></rss>
